# Graphics & Assets

Essential guidelines for optimizing graphics and assets in Roblox UI development.

## üé® File Format Guidelines

### Vector Graphics (SVGs) Not Supported

Roblox Studio **does not natively support vector graphics (SVGs)** for UI elements. The UI system primarily uses **raster image formats** (PNG, JPG, TGA, BMP).

### Recommended File Type: High-Resolution PNGs

- **Best Practice:** Design UI assets in vector software (e.g., Illustrator, Figma, Inkscape).
- **Export As:** High-resolution PNG files with transparent backgrounds. PNGs offer lossless quality and transparency.

## üìè Recommended Element Sizes

These are general visual targets; final display size depends on UI layout:

- **Small Icons:** 32x32px to 64x64px
- **Medium Icons:** 64x64px to 128x128px
- **Large Icons/Elements:** 128x128px and up

## üîÑ Scaling Strategies

### Leverage Roblox's Built-In Scaling

- **Export High-Resolution:** Export PNGs at a significantly higher resolution than their anticipated in-game display size (e.g., 512x512px or 1024x1024px for a 64x64px expected display).
- **How it Works:** When a high-res PNG is applied to an ImageLabel or ImageButton, Roblox's engine automatically downscales it to fit the UI element's dimensions.
- **Benefit:** Downscaling from a high-resolution source results in a much sharper, less pixelated appearance, mimicking vector-like crispness without exporting multiple file sizes.

### Dynamic Scaling with Slice 9

- **Purpose:** For UI elements (buttons, frames, panels) that need to stretch while maintaining consistent borders and appearance.
- **How it Works:** Defines nine regions (corners, edges, center) of an image. When resized:
    - **Corners:** Remain fixed.
    - **Edges:** Stretch along their axis.
    - **Center:** Tiles or stretches to fill space.
- **Configuration:** Set ImageLabel or ImageButton's `ScaleType` to `Slice` and adjust the `SliceCenter` property.

## üéØ Implementation with React Lua

When using `react-lua`, apply these graphics principles through the `ScaleType` and `SliceCenter` properties:

```lua
-- Example: Slice 9 button implementation
return React.createElement("ImageButton", {
    Image = "rbxassetid://1234567890",
    ScaleType = Enum.ScaleType.Slice,
    SliceCenter = Rect.new(10, 10, 90, 90), -- 10px border on 100x100 image
    Size = UDim2.new(0, 200, 0, 50), -- Stretches while maintaining borders
})
```

## üìã Best Practices Summary

1. **Design in Vector:** Use vector software for crisp, scalable designs
2. **Export High-Res PNGs:** Always export at 2-4x the intended display size
3. **Use Slice 9:** For elements that need to stretch (buttons, panels, frames)
4. **Maintain Transparency:** PNG format preserves transparency for overlays
5. **Test Scaling:** Verify assets look good at various sizes and aspect ratios
